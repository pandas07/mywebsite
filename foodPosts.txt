<p id="friedRolls">Fried Rolls (1 April 2015)<br /><br />
It's my first day in Hong Kong and my aunt took me to her old workplace to eat dinner. I was already so 
full from lunch with my uncle, so after this meal, I was stuffed. The food was so good, I really wish my 
stomach was bigger. We had deep fried rolls with shrimp and vegetables inside. I totally recommend
this place if anyone is ever in the Tsz Wan Shan Shopping Mall. It's on the 5th floor.</p>

I've been spending too much money lately, so when Tiffany wanted to go out for lunch this weekend, I chose the
cheapest item possible...quinoa porridge. At least it's...healthy? It's my first time trying quinoa, and it was 
alright. I think there could have been more sweetness added to it, but I think I don't need any 
more sugar in my system. I was also saving my stomach for the pulled pork that I wanted to try 
at the Farmers' Market. I don't recommend eating the quinoa porridge, but I definitely recommend
the pulled pork sandwich!</p>

I visited my friend Maryam this weekend, and today was my last day. Being the indecisive people 
that we are, we somehow ended up going to Pizza Hut for lunch.

I'm on a quest to find all the good food to eat in Leeds, so I looked on TripAdvisor for guidance and
I found Humpit's! It's a Mediterranean food restaurant and is vegan friendly. I'm not vegan, but it was
really good. I highly recommend this place!

Today I ate dinner with Sumiko and her friends. It was my first time having dinner at a pub!</p>
