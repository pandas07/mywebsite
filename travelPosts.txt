I joined the Leeds Wilderness Society, and I'm so glad I did. This past weekend was pretty awesome! I didn't ask any of my friends to go
with me, so I was afraid of not knowing anyone and feeling left out. Luckily, everyone was so friendly and nice! It was one of the best
weekends I've had so far since I've arrived in Leeds. On Friday, we arrived at our cabin at around 9pm and settled in. It was a two-story
cabin, with all the bunks on the second story. There were 8 bunks in total. It was a 3-hour car ride from Leeds, so we tried to get as
much sleep as we could that night to wake up early for the next day. <br /><br />
On Saturday, we got up early to eat some breakfast and then we put on our hiking boots and layers of clothing. The weather in Lake District
isn't particularly great...It was time for our 16 kilometre hikes! It was a struggle because I haven't exercised in so long. The first 30
minutes of our hike was going uphill. I died a little inside. </p>

So it's true. Scotland is really beautiful! Finally, we're here at the Isle of Skye. The journey was long and tiring. First, a two hour plane
ride from London to Glasgow, and then a 6 hour bus ride from Glasgow to Isle of Skye. Too much sitting on my butt, and I already get enough
of that. I only had a few hours in Glasgow to explore, and I really loved the vibe of the city. Everything was so...pleasant. The city is
geared towards tourists because there's free Wifi, which is <i>awesome!!</i> And there's even a mobile app to guide us through the city 
attractions. So crazy, right? <br /><br />
Tomorrow, we're going on a tour. Tiffany wants to see the Fairy Pools, which is one of the major attractions there apparently. But the thing
is that can only go to that place if the weather is good. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it will get any better. It's been looking pretty
gloomy, and the weather forecast says there's a good chance it will rain tomorrow.</p>

Today I ate breakfast with my uncle and cousin Sophy and then afterwards, my cousins and I took the ferry to Cheung Chau or "Long Island." It
was fun, and I had a great time! The thing about me is that I'm super indecisive. And my cousins are indecisive. So they kept asking me what I 
wanted to do, and I kept responding with, "Anything you want to do." It was tough. But the only things you could really do on that island were
sight-seeing and eating, which we did. I especially enjoyed the eating part. We ate this pancake thing. I don't know what was in it, but it was
SO GOOD. I think I saw some cabbage...and some vegetables...I really don't know. I also had fish balls and shaved ice. <br /><br />
We went back at around 9pm and took some pictures with the big ferris wheel! Wow, Hong Kong is so beautiful at night. I really love the city 
lights at night. Can I stay, please?</p>

All I did was stay at home today. I know, why am I staying at home when I'm in Hong Kong?! This crazy girl. Well, I didn't come to Hong Kong just
to go out every single day. I really came to visit my family, and plus, I <i>really</i> had some work to do. It's just so nice to be in a home-y
atmosphere. I'm constantly reminded of home and how much I miss my parents and siblings. Back at Leeds, I've made great friends, but there's no
one I could really turn to if I'm sad. I've been talking to one of my friends back home, but it's not the same as the physical comfort that 
family members can provide.</p>

Today my cousin Stephy and I went to this place called "Yuan Long." Two of her friends lived in the area and joined us. They're super nice
guys and it was actually fun because for the first time, some of her friends wanted to get to know me. I don't know if it's just me, but
in the previous hangouts with her friends, her friends didn't try to get to know me. I'd feel a little left out sometimes, but thankfully
not today! It was funny because Stephy and I are the same age, and they were trying to guess how old I was. They both assumed that Stephy
was older than I am (which she is, by 3 months), but I could tell she didn't like that they said that. I was about to tell them my age, but
Stephy wouldn't let me. I guess age is a sensitive subject for her...<br /><br />
I haven't ridden a bike in such a long time...so my bike-riding skills were a little rusty. We biked along a trail, and I enjoyed the view. 
When we almost reached the end of the trail, we saw a ton of people gathering around. TVB, a Hong Kong drama production company, was filming
a drama! For the first time, I got to see how they make movies. It was SO COOL. My mom loves TVB, so I made sure to take a lot of pictures to
show her. </p>

Baking is so fun! Recently, my aunt has been teaching me how to make egg tarts, cakes (the very fluffy ones, YUM), and hot dog buns.
Ahh, she is so talented! My parents are looking forward to having me make dim sum for them, but I can't guarantee that I'll do a very good
job. But I have such awesome parents and they said, "As long as we can eat it!" They're so kind...</br></br>
My favorite thing to make is mantou (which is just steamed bread) and bao (steamed buns with meat or whatever filling you want to put
inside). I cannot wait to try to make them when I get back home! Plus, I just found out that my dad got a large mixing machine for his
birthday, which isn't even until June...My mom said, "Aunt Cindy bought it for you to bake stuff for Dad." I think she's right because
Dad doesn't even bake...?! Everyone knows I'm the one who does the baking.</p>

My first night in Dublin wasn't so great. Tiffany and I had some technical difficulties. Both our smartphones died. I only had my dumbphone,
and for some reason it wasn't accepting any calls. So we spent about an hour looking for each other. We both had to borrow phones from 
strangers to reach each other. Luckily, I met some really kind people and they let me stay with them until I found Tiffany.</p>

I got to visit my friend Maryam this weekend! She's one of my good friends from high school, and coincidentally we're both studying
abroad this semester. She studies at the University of Kent. I'm so glad I got to visit her because it was so good to catch up. I missed
talking to her so much! It's always a fun time with her! I wish we had gone to the same university.</p>

I can't believe I am finally in Hong Kong! After a 3 hour flight from Amsterdam to Moscow and then a 9 hour flight
from Moscow to Hong Kong, I have finally made it! When I arrived at the Hong Kong Airport today, I expected to 
immediately see my uncle waiting for me. Unfortunately, I did not. I ended up having to Facebook message my cousin,
Sophy, and she gave me his number to call. I looked around for someone to borrow a phone from. When I finally found
a person who seemed nice enough to let me borrow his phone, he looked skeptical, as if I would steal his phone. But 
fortunately, he still let me use it. And it turns out my uncle was waiting at Exit B, instead of Exit A. <br /><br />
The bus back to Tsz Wan Shan was about an hour long, and for some reason, I wasn't tired at all. I wasn't hungry
but my uncle suggested going out for lunch, and of course I could not resist saying no to dim sum! And that's when
my fat-gaining journey began.</p>
